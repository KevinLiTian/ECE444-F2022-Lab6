## Pros & Cons of Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) includes writing small test, write some code to pass the test, then refactor the code.

Since each cycle in TDD requires programmers to write a small test and modular codes, it will force the code to be modular and thus help programmers learn good modular design patterns. Also, it helps document the code, making the code easier to maintain and refactor. It makes collaboration easier since each team member can use testing as indicator of whether their code breaks other parts of the project.

On the otherhand, TDD slows down the development in the early phase of the project. And if the test cases are written poorly, it loses the purpose to do TDD. It is hard to apply to existing code base or legacy code since they are not tested. Creating tests for failures can be tedious.
